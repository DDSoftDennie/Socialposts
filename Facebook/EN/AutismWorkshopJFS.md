AUTISM WORKSHOP ANNOUNCEMENT

On Wednesday, July 30th 2024, I will be hosting a workshop at the Java Forum Stuttgart (JFS) workshop day! The workshop will be about Autism and how it manifests at workplace. I will be discussing the challenges that people with Autism face in the workplace and how we can make the workplace more inclusive for them. I will also be sharing some tips and strategies for employers and colleagues on how to support people with Autism in the workplace.

It's an honor to be able to collaborate with the organizers of JFS and I'm really looking forward to this event. I hope to see many of you there!
